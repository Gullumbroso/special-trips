## 1. Objective

Deliver a lean v1 of SpecialTrips that validates the core hypothesis:
ðŸ‘‰ Users who love culture, music, sports, art, and local experiences will value curated **trip bundles** suggestions that combine 2â€“3 interesting events happening in the same destination within a 4â€“8 day span.

## 2. Capabilities
- Capturing user preferences (events, music, date range).
- Generating a list of suggested bundles (event-first trips) using the **ChatGPT 5 mini** model, via the **OpenAI api**. 
**FOR NOW WE WILL START WITH docs/04_data_samples.md AS DATA SAMPLE.**
- Allowing users to explore the bundles details.
- Allowing users to edit their preferences and regenerate bundles.

## 3. Out of scope for now
- No flight and hotel search
- No Spotify integration
- No chat interface
- No analytics
- Mobile only -- no desktop version
