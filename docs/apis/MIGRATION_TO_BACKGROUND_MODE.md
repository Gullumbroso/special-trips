# Migration to OpenAI Background Mode - Complete

## What Changed

This refactor migrated the app from a complex Redis + Inngest architecture to OpenAI's Background Mode, eliminating timeout issues and simplifying the codebase.

## Files Created

### New API Endpoints
- **`src/app/api/openai/responses/[id]/route.ts`** - Proxy endpoint that retrieves OpenAI response status server-side
  - Calls `openai.responses.retrieve(id)` with server-side API key
  - Extracts reasoning summaries and bundles
  - Returns status to client

## Files Modified

### API Routes
- **`src/app/api/generate-bundles/route.ts`**
  - Removed: Redis and Inngest dependencies
  - Added: OpenAI client with background mode
  - Now creates background response and returns `responseId` immediately
  - Uses `background: true` and `store: true` parameters

### Client
- **`src/app/loading_bundles/page.tsx`**
  - Changed localStorage key from `special-trips-session-id` to `special-trips-response-id`
  - Updated state variable from `sessionId` to `responseId`
  - Changed polling endpoint from `/api/session/[id]` to `/api/openai/responses/[id]`
  - Updated status checks from Redis statuses to OpenAI statuses:
    - `'generating'` → `'in_progress'` or `'queued'`
    - `'complete'` → `'completed'`
    - `'error'` → `'failed'`

## Files Deleted

### Infrastructure Files
- ❌ `src/lib/redis.ts` - All Redis session management
- ❌ `src/lib/inngest/client.ts` - Inngest client setup
- ❌ `src/lib/inngest/functions.ts` - Worker function (~246 lines)
- ❌ `src/app/api/inngest/route.ts` - Webhook endpoint
- ❌ `src/app/api/session/[id]/route.ts` - Redis polling endpoint

## Packages Removed

```bash
npm uninstall inngest @upstash/redis
```

Removed:
- `inngest` - Background job processing (no longer needed)
- `@upstash/redis` - Redis client (no longer needed)

## Environment Variables Cleanup

### Remove from Vercel Dashboard

Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables → Delete:

1. ❌ `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
2. ❌ `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
3. ❌ `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`
4. ❌ `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`

### Keep These Variables

✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for background mode
✅ `OPENGRAPH_API_KEY` - Still used for image fetching

### Local `.env.local` Cleanup

Remove the same 4 variables from your local `.env.local` file.

## External Service Cleanup

### Upstash Dashboard
- Delete the Redis database (no longer needed)
- Or keep it for other projects, just remove from this one

### Inngest Dashboard
- Delete the app/functions
- Or unregister the webhook from special-trips project

### Vercel Integrations
- Remove Inngest integration (if installed via marketplace)
- Remove Upstash integration (if installed via marketplace)

## How Background Mode Works

### Previous Architecture (Complex)
```
Client → /api/generate-bundles → Inngest.send() → /api/inngest webhook
         ↓                                              ↓
    Returns sessionId                            Worker streams OpenAI
         ↓                                              ↓
    Polls /api/session/[id] ← Redis ← Worker writes summaries
         ↓
    Gets bundles when complete
```

**Problems:**
- Vercel 300s timeout on webhook
- Inngest retries creating infinite loops
- Redis connection issues (ECONNRESET)
- Complex multi-service orchestration

### New Architecture (Simple)
```
Client → /api/generate-bundles → openai.responses.create(background: true)
         ↓                                              ↓
    Returns responseId                           OpenAI runs task async
         ↓                                              ↓
    Polls /api/openai/responses/[id] → openai.responses.retrieve(id)
         ↓
    Gets bundles when complete
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No Vercel timeouts (OpenAI handles execution)
- ✅ No retries (task completes successfully)
- ✅ No Redis (OpenAI stores state)
- ✅ Simpler code (~340 lines deleted)
- ✅ Lower costs (no Redis/Inngest subscriptions)
- ✅ Same UX (polling pattern unchanged)

## Function Calling Support

**CONFIRMED:** Background mode supports function calling!

The app uses `fetch_event_images` function defined in the OpenAI prompt dashboard. Background mode automatically:
1. Calls the function when needed
2. Waits for execution
3. Continues processing with results

Function calling works seamlessly without any webhook setup.

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Fresh generation (no cached responseId)
- [ ] Page refresh during generation (resumes from localStorage)
- [ ] Error handling (simulate OpenAI failure)
- [ ] Completion flow (bundles saved, navigation works)
- [ ] Function calling (image fetching still works)
- [ ] Reasoning summaries display correctly

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the old architecture is preserved in Git history:
```bash
git log --all -- src/lib/redis.ts
git log --all -- src/lib/inngest/
```

To rollback:
1. Revert commits
2. Reinstall packages: `npm install inngest @upstash/redis`
3. Re-add environment variables
4. Redeploy
